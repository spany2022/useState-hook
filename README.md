# React Hook Guessing Game

Welcome to the React Hook Guessing Game repository! This simple React project is designed to help you understand and practice using React hooks, specifically focusing on the `useState` hook.

## Project Overview

### Description

Guess the React hook used in this project! The application dynamically reveals the answer when you click the button. The main goal is to showcase the usage of the `useState` hook for state management in React functional components.

### How It Works

1. The initial state is set to a prompt asking users to guess the React hook.
2. Clicking the "Click me to know the answer" button triggers a function (`clickForAnswer`) that updates the state to reveal the correct answer - `useState`.
3. The answer is dynamically displayed on the page.
